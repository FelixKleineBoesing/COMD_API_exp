# COMD_API_exp
First attempt to script a call to the Comdirect bank API, retrieve most recent transactions (current month, or last 3 months).
organize the data into different columns depending on keywords within the transaction description.
save monthly dfs into csv
generate a final main df that specifies the total amount spent on each category per month.
A final yearly analysis should be fairly straight forward with the date stored.
